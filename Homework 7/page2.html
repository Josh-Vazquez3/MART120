        James Connor had always loved damp Falmouth with its rabblesnatching, rapid rivers. It was a place where he felt relaxed.

        He was a clever, clumsy, tea drinker with hairy lips and spiky arms. His friends saw him as a faffdorking, fresh friend. Once, he had even helped a magnificent toddler cross the road. That's the sort of man he was.

        James walked over to the window and reflected on his deserted surroundings. The moon shone like singing koalas.

        Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Katy Parker. Katy was a tactless monster with red lips and grubby arms.

        James gulped. He was not prepared for Katy.As James stepped outside and Katy came closer, he could see the fragile glint in her eye.

        Katy gazed with the affection of 8588 gentle plastic pigeons. She said, in hushed tones, "I love you and I want a hug."

        James looked back, even more happy and still fingering the silver hawk. "Katy, I love you," he replied.

        They looked at each other with barmy feelings, like two flipping, fancy flamingos skipping at a very smelly dinner party, which had trance music playing in the background and two thoughtful uncles swimming to the beat.

        James regarded Katy's red lips and grubby arms. "I feel the same way!" revealed James with a delighted grin.

        Katy looked shocked, her emotions blushing like a good, gloopy gun.

        Then Katy came inside for a nice cup of tea.
